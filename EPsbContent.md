Public-key cryptography, on the other hand, is quite new.\
It was publicly introduced by Whitfield Diffie, Martin Hellman and Ralph Merkle in 1976.\
The Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange was the first asymmetric algorithm.\
Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a very popular encryption standard created by the National Security Agency.\
DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm) is a United States Government encryption standard often used for digital signing.\
