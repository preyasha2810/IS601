## Packet routing

The packet switching concept was first invented by Paul Baran in the early 1960's, and then independently a few years later by Donald Davies.\
Leonard Kleinrock conducted early research in the related field of digital message switching, and helped build the ARPANET, the world's first packet switching network.
