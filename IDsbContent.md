## IP address and DNS

Robert Kahn of BBN and Vint Cerf of DARPA invented TCP/IP which gave birth to IP Addresses in 1970s  and adopted as the protocol standard for ARPANET (the predecessor to the Internet) in 1983.\
Paul Mockapetris expanded the Internet beyond its academic origins by inventing the Domain Name System (DNS) in 1983.\
The IP address space is managed globally by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\
IP addresses are classified into several classes of operational characteristics: unicast, multicast, anycast and broadcast addressing.\
Dynamic DNS is a method of automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name System, often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.
